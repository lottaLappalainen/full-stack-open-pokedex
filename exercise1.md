The application that is in active development by a team of 6 people is being coded by C++. For C++ project linting can be done by Clang-Tidy. It is configured by creating a .clang-tidy file in project and itâ€™s easily integrated into CI pipelines. Testing can be done by Google Test which has a wide range of features and tools. But because we have a smaller scale project, we might rather use Catch2 which has simpler API and is quicker and more straightforward to use. Build tools for C++ project from Microsoft can be installed in Visual Studio Code.  

The CI could be set up with using AWS CodePipeline. If the project uses any other AWS tools, the CodePipeline can directly interface with them. Another choice could also be Bitbucket pipelines. Bitbucket pipelines is easy to set up and it can be deployed to production infrastructure as well.  

In my opinion this setup would be better hosted in a cloud-based environment. The team and project are on a smaller-scale, so cloud-based environment is more likely cheaper. Easier configuration compared to self-hosted environment saves our small team their valuable time and a potential hassle. We can use AWS tools for cloud-based environment which would match with CI set up with AWS CodePipeline.
